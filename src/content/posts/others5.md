## 文字稿

Thank you.
谢谢。

I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.
今天，我很荣幸能与你们一起参加这所世界顶尖大学的毕业典礼。

Truth be told, I never graduated from college,
说实话，我从未从大学毕业，

and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
而这是我离大学毕业最近的一次。

Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life.
今天，我想向你们讲述我人生中的三个故事。

That's it.
就这样。

No big deal.
没什么大不了的。

Just three stories.
只是三个故事。

The first story is about connecting the dots.
第一个故事是关于如何串联生命中的点滴。

I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months,
我在里德学院读了六个月就退学了，

but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
但之后又作为旁听生待了大约18个月才真正离开。

So why'd I drop out?
那么，我为什么要退学呢？

It started before I was born.
这要从我出生前说起。

My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,
我的生母是一位年轻的未婚研究生，

and she decided to put me up for adoption.
她决定把我送去收养。

She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
她非常强烈地希望我能被大学毕业生收养，

so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
所以一切都已经安排好了，我一出生就会被一位律师和他的妻子收养。

Except that when I popped out,
只是在我出生的时候，

they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
他们在最后一刻决定他们真正想要的是女孩。

So my parents, who were on a waiting list,
所以我的父母，当时还在候补名单上，

got a call in the middle of the night asking,
半夜接到一个电话，

"We've got an unexpected baby boy.
“我们这儿有一个意外出生的男婴，

Do you want him?"
你们想要他吗？”

They said, "Of course."
他们回答道：“当然要。”

"My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college,
“后来，我的生母发现我的养母没有从大学毕业，

and that my father had never graduated from high school.
而我的养父甚至连高中都没毕业。

She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
她拒绝签署最终的收养文件。

She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.
直到几个月后，我的养父母承诺会让我上大学，她才勉强同意。

This was the start in my life."
这就是我生命的起点。”

And 17 years later, I did go to college.
十七年后，我确实上了大学。

But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford.
但我天真地选择了一所几乎和斯坦福一样贵的大学，

And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
我那工薪阶层的父母的所有积蓄都花在了我的学费上。

After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
六个月后，我看不出这其中的价值所在。

I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life,
我不知道自己想要如何度过一生，

and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
也不知道大学如何能帮我找到答案。

And here I was,
而此刻，

spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life.
我却在花着父母毕生的积蓄。

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.
于是我决定退学，并相信一切都会好起来。

It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back,
当时这决定令人惶恐，但回首往事，

it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
那却是我做过的最明智的选择之一。

The minute I dropped out,
从退学那一刻起，

I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me,
我就可以不再上那些我不感兴趣的必修课，

and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.
转而旁听那些看起来更有意思的课程。

It wasn't all romantic.
这并非全然浪漫。

I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms.
我没有宿舍，只能睡在朋友房间的地板上。

I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with.
我靠回收可乐瓶的五分钱押金买食物充饥。

And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
每个星期天晚上，我会步行七英里穿过市区，只为在哈雷·克里希纳神庙吃上一顿好饭。

I loved it.
我乐在其中。

And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
我跟随好奇心和直觉所涉猎的许多事物，后来都成了无价之宝。

Let me give you one example.
让我给你们举个例子。

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
当时里德学院提供了可能是全国最好的书法课程。

And I was very happy to see that I was able to do this.
我很高兴看到自己能够做到这一点。

Throughout the campus, every poster,
校园里的每一张海报，

every label on every drawer was beautifully hand-calligraphed.
每一个抽屉上的标签，都是精美的手写书法。

Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
因为我退学了，不必上常规课程，

I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
我决定选修一门书法课，学习如何书写。

I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces,
我学习了衬线字体和无衬线字体，

about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,
学习了如何调整不同字母组合之间的间距，

about what makes great typography great.
以及是什么让优秀的排版变得出色。

And I found it fascinating.
我觉得这一切非常迷人。

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
当时我完全没想过这些知识会在我的生活中有什么实际应用。

But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
但十年后，当我们设计第一台Macintosh电脑时，

it all came back to me.
这一切都回到了我的记忆中。

And we designed it all into the Mac.
我们将这些设计全部融入了Mac中。

It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
它是第一台拥有精美排版的电脑。

If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
如果我没有在大学里偶然旁听那门课程，

the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
Mac就不会有多种字体或比例间距的字体。

And since Windows just copied the Mac,
而由于Windows只是复制了Mac，

it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
很可能个人电脑上就不会有这些功能。

If I had never dropped out,
如果我没有退学，

I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class.
我就不会去旁听那门书法课。

And personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
个人电脑可能就不会有现在这样美妙的排版。

Of course,
当然，

it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
我在大学时无法预见到这些点如何连接。

But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
但十年后回顾时，这一切变得非常、非常清晰。

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward.
再次强调，你无法预知这些点如何连接。

You can only connect them looking backwards.
你只能在回顾时将它们连接起来。

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
所以你必须相信，这些点会在你的未来以某种方式连接起来。

You have to trust in something.
你必须相信某些东西。

Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
你的直觉、命运、生活、因果，无论什么。

Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart,
因为相信这些点滴会在未来串联起来，会给你信心去追随你的内心，

even when it leads you off the well-worn path.
即使它会带你偏离常规的道路。

And that will make all the difference.
而这将会带来一切的不同。

My second story is about love and loss.
我的第二个故事是关于爱与失去。

I was lucky.
我很幸运。

I found what I loved to do early in life.
我早早地找到了我热爱的事业。

Waz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20.

We worked hard.

My third story is about death.
我的第三个故事是关于死亡的。

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like,
当我17岁的时候，我读到一句话，大意是：

"If you live each day as if it was your last,
“如果你把每一天都当作生命的最后一天来活，

someday you'll most certainly be right."
总有一天你会确信无疑。”

It made an impression on me.
这句话给我留下了深刻的印象。

And since then, for the past 33 years,
从那时起，在过去的33年里，

I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself,
我每天早上都会照镜子问自己：

"If today were the last day of my life,
“如果今天是我生命的最后一天，

would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
我是否愿意去做今天打算做的事情？”

And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row,
每当连续多天的答案都是“不”时，

I know I need to change something.
我就知道需要做出一些改变了。

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
记住自己即将死去，是我所遇到的最重要的工具，它帮助我在生活中做出重大选择。

Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride,
因为几乎所有的事情，包括所有的期望、所有的骄傲、

all fear of embarrassment or failure,
所有对难堪或失败的恐惧，

these things just fall away in the face of death,
在死亡面前都会消失，

leaving only what is truly important.
留下的只有真正重要的东西。

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
记住你即将死去，这是我所知道的避免陷入患得患失陷阱的最好方法。

You are already naked.
你已经赤身裸体了，

There is no reason not to follow your heart.
没有理由不跟随自己的心。

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.
大约一年前，我被诊断出患有癌症。

I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
我在早上7:30做了一个扫描，清楚地显示我的胰腺上有一个肿瘤。

I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
我甚至不知道胰腺是什么。

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
医生告诉我，这几乎肯定是一种无法治愈的癌症，我预计活不过三到六个月。

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
我的医生建议我回家，把事务安排好，

which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
这是医生对准备死亡的委婉说法。

It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
这意味着要尝试在短短几个月内，告诉孩子们你原本以为未来十年才会对他们说的一切。

It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
这意味着要确保所有事情都安排妥当，以便家人能尽可能轻松应对。

It means to say your goodbyes.

I live with that diagnosis all day.

Later that evening,
那天晚上晚些时候，

I had a biopsy where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,

through my stomach and into my intestines,

put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,

told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope,

the doctor started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
医生哭了，因为结果显示这是一种非常罕见的胰腺癌，可以通过手术治愈。

I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
我接受了手术，幸运的是，我现在康复了。

This was the closest I've been to facing death,
这是我离死亡最近的一次，

and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
我希望这也是未来几十年内我离死亡最近的一次。

Having lived through it,
经历过这一切后，

I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.
我现在可以比死亡还只是一个有用但纯粹抽象概念时，更加肯定地告诉你们：

no one wants to die.
没有人愿意死去。

Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
即便是那些向往天堂的人，也不愿以死亡为代价前往。

And yet, death is the destination we all share.
然而，死亡是我们共同的终点。

No one has ever escaped it, and that is as it should be,
无人能逃脱，这是命中注定，

because death is very likely the single best invention of life.
因为死亡很可能是生命最伟大的发明。

It's life's change agent, it clears out the old to make way for the new.
它是生命的变革推动者，清除旧物，为新生让路。

Right now, the new is you.
此刻，新生代就是你们。

But someday, not too long from now,
但不久的将来，

you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
你们也将逐渐老去，被时代淘汰。

Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.
抱歉说得如此戏剧化，但这是事实。

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
你们的时光有限，所以不要浪费在过别人的生活上。

Don't be trapped by dogma,
不要被教条束缚，

which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
那意味着活在他人思考的结果之中。

Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.
不要让别人的意见淹没了你内心的声音。

And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
最重要的是，要有勇气追随你的内心和直觉。

They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
它们某种程度上已经知道你真正想要成为什么。

Everything else is secondary.
其他一切都是次要的。

When I was young,
当我年轻的时候，

there was an amazing publication called the Whole Earth Catalog,
有一本很棒的出版物叫做《全球概览》，

which was one of the Bibles of my generation.
它是我们那一代人的圣经之一。

It was created by a fellow named Stuart Brand,

not far from here in Menlo Park.
就在离这里不远的门洛帕克。

And he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

This was in the late 60s,
那是在60年代末，

before personal computers and desktop publishing.
个人电脑和桌面出版出现之前。

It was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras.
它全部是用打字机、剪刀和宝丽来相机制作的。

It was sort of like Google in paperback form,
它有点像平装版的谷歌，

35 years before Google came along.
在谷歌出现前35年。

It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.
它充满了理想主义，充斥着简洁的工具和伟大的理念。

Stuart and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog.
斯图尔特和他的团队出版了几期《全球概览》。

And then, when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.
然后，当它完成了自己的使命时，他们出版了最后一期。

It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
那是70年代中期，我和你们现在一样大。

On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road,
在他们最后一期的封底上，有一张清晨乡间小路的照片，

the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
那种如果你有冒险精神，可能会发现自己搭便车经过的路。

Beneath it were the words, "Stay hungry, stay foolish."
照片下方写着：“求知若饥，虚心若愚。”

It was their farewell message as they signed off.
这是他们停刊时的告别语。

"Stay hungry, stay foolish."
“求知若饥，虚心若愚。”

And I have always wished that for myself.
我总是希望自己能够那样。

And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
现在，在你们即将毕业，开始新生活的时候，我也希望你们能这样。

Stay hungry, stay foolish.
求知若饥，虚心若愚。

Thank you all very much.
非常感谢大家。
